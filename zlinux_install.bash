# Installation script for S390x Ubuntu 18.04 .
# Does not necessarily work with prior or later version of Ubuntu.
# Obtains virgin ISO from Ubuntu, runs hercules-based install and then creates runtime environment.
# Uses a provided Hercules environment and not any pre-installed version of Hercules.

# v0.1 get location of ISO
# v0.2 inform user where it's being taken from
# v0.3 use scripts/ scripts to download, mount, create hdisk
# v0.4 Use our supplied hercules
# v0.5 detect OS and distro and block if not compatible
# v0.6 check for sudo
# v0.7 fix paths to relative not to userid relative (not ~./ )
# v0.8 auto-tune hercules.cnf
# v0.9 ask user to press enter to start hercules so they can see it will last a while
# v1.0 fix permissions
# v1.1 don't allow execution as user root
# v1.2 fixed RAM calculation
# v1.3 remove unused, unnecessary, and broken code;
#      always exist with error status when exiting due to error
# v1.4 do not leave directories without execute bit set
# v1.5 offer 27GB (3390-27) disk option; improve DASD creation
# v1.6 switch to template-based preseed and hercules.cnf creation
# v1.7 use a Hercules build with a relative rpath set
# v1.8 run as regular user, only using sudo when necessary
# v1.9 detect successful installation
# v1.10 misc fixes:
#         put all log messages for this run in same log file
#         fixup permissions of set_network log
#         dasdinit log typo
#         rename assets directory to templates
# v1.11 Make sure we have the route command available before we go too far
# v1.12 Syntax improvements, better logging
# v1.13 remove requirement for net-tools
